# GOAL
Quick-and-dirty converter of HTML output files from Kindle export highlights to Markdown.

# USAGE
In order to convert one file we use the following command:
`python main.py path_to_input_html_file path_to_output_markdown_file`

We can also convert all .html files in a directory using the following:
`python main.py directory_with_html_files`

The resulting Markdown files will be generated in the same directory with the same name of the original html file.
